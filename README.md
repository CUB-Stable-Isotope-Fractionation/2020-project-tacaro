# Assignment

 1. Make a set of exercises for your project ([`project.Rmd`](project.Rmd)) that illustrate how your system works. The exercises should be possible to step through and discuss over the course of 30 minutes and should highlight interesting points about your system. You will be leading the exercises in class.
 2. Generate a `project_solutions.Rmd` file with solutions to the exercises and answers to the questions raised in ([`project.Rmd`](project.Rmd)). This will not be added to GitHub (anything with `solution` in the name is automatically excluded) but should be submitted to your instructor for review. The solutions will be made avalable to your classmates on Canvas after class.
 3. Make sure to commit the rest of your project to GitHub so your classmates can pull the repository to work through the exercises.

## Setup

1. if you have an open project in your RStudio Server, close it by choosing **Close Project** from the Project dropdown button in the upper right corner (it should say `Project: (None)` afterwards)
2. switch to the terminal tab and go to the home directory by executing `cd`
3. `git clone` this repository
4. load the new project by navigating to and clicking on the `project.Rproj` file
